Agent 6: Course Intelligence (Fee-Based Segmentation)

Determines course segment using OBJECTIVE green fees (not AI interpretation).

Performance:
- Success Rate: 90%+ (most courses publish fees)
- Cost: $0.00 (FREE - reuses Agent 7 SkyGolf scrape)
- Speed: ~1s (just regex extraction)
- Accuracy: 100% (fees are facts, not opinions)

Strategy:
1. Extract weekend green fees from SkyGolf content (Agent 7 already scraped this!)
2. Apply objective tier logic based on industry standards
3. Calculate opportunity scores (ball retrieval + lease programs)

Segmentation Tiers (based on weekend fees):
- High-End: $75+ (premium public, semi-private, upscale daily fee)
- Both: $50-74 (mid-market, serves multiple segments)
- Budget: <$50 (value golf, municipal, economy)

Why Fee-Based Works:
- Fees reflect course positioning (premium vs value)
- Objective data (no AI interpretation needed)
- Industry standard (all golfers use fees to judge)
- Accurate (Bristow $75-99 = high-end, not budget!)
