# Golf Enrichment v2 - Progress Tracking

**Project:** Enhanced enrichment workflow with BUY/SELL opportunity classification
**Started:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** üü° In Progress - Phase 2.0 (Data Flow Validation)

---

## üìç Current Phase

**Phase 2.0: Data Flow Validation**
- Goal: Validate V2 JSON ‚Üí Render parsers ‚Üí Supabase data flow
- Status: Ready to begin implementation

## üéØ Session Log

### Session 1 - October 31, 2025 (Morning)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Ideated buy/sell opportunity classification strategy
- ‚úÖ Defined 4-phase architecture (LLM ‚Üí Enrichment ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí ClickUp)
- ‚úÖ Created tracking documentation structure

**Decisions Made:**
1. **LLM does heavy lifting** - Research, classification, extraction (not just prompt engineering)
2. **Agents stay focused** - Email finding (Apollo/Hunter), data merging, syncing
3. **Test both output formats** - Markdown vs JSON, pick winner based on parsing quality
4. **Scoring in Organizer** - Deterministic math, not LLM (easier to adjust weights)
5. **Process incomplete data** - Tag 'needs_human_review', don't lose leads

**Blockers/Questions:**
- None currently

**Next Session Goals:**
1. Build LLM Research Agent with enhanced 8-section prompt
2. Test markdown vs JSON output format on 1 test course
3. Validate classification accuracy on 3 test courses (BUY, SELL, BOTH)

---

### Session 2 - October 31, 2025 (Afternoon)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive 8-section LLM research prompt (`prompts/enhanced_research_v1.md`)
- ‚úÖ Designed optimized JSON response schema with inline citations (`schemas/llm_response_v1.json`)
- ‚úÖ Built test course definitions with 3 test courses: The Neuse Golf Club, Pinehurst No. 2, Bethpage Black (`test_courses.json`)
- ‚úÖ Created automated test runner script with validation (`test_prompt.py`)
- ‚úÖ Created results tracking template (`results/TEMPLATE.md`)
- ‚úÖ Created testing directory guide (`CLAUDE.md`)

**Decisions Made:**
1. **All 8 sections in one prompt** - Test comprehensive approach (vs incremental)
2. **Optimize JSON schema for LLM output quality** - Not strict architecture field names yet
3. **Inline citations with each data point** - Each signal/contact has its own source field
4. **Explicit null handling** - LLM instructed to use null for missing single values
5. **JSON output format** - Structured output with code block detection for parsing

**Test Infrastructure Created:**

### Session 3 - October 31, 2025 (Evening)

**User Feedback on V1 Prompt:**
- ‚úÖ V1 comprehensive prompt created successfully
- ‚ùå 8-section prompt deemed "too extreme" for current business needs
- ‚ùå Complexity creates unnecessary parsing overhead for core targeting use case

**Business Requirements Clarification:**
User identified the **minimum essential data** needed for automation:

1. **Course Ranking (CRITICAL):** Premium / Mid / Budget classification
   - Used for automated campaign categorization
   - Needs pricing evidence + confidence level
   - Replaces complex 8-section BUY/SELL/BOTH classification

2. **Water Hazards Assessment:** Yes/No + count if present
   - Are lots of hazards in play?
   - Simpler than full retrieval service analysis

3. **Volume Indicator:** Estimated annual rounds per year
   - Key targeting metric
   - Based on tee times, course type, location research

4. **Reliable Contact Data (CRITICAL):** Names, emails, LinkedIn, phone
   - Must maintain v1 quality and source citations
   - General Manager/Owner, Superintendent, Director of Golf
   - Work emails preferred, employment verification

5. **Basic Course Intelligence:** Ownership, recent changes, vendors, selling points
   - Simplified from v1's deep intelligence gathering
   - Focus on actionable targeting insights only

**Decision: Create V2 Simplified Prompt**
- **Target length:** ~100-150 lines (vs v1's 459 lines)
- **Sections:** 5 focused sections (vs v1's 8 comprehensive sections)
- **Output:** Simpler JSON schema optimized for parsing
- **Maintain:** Source citations (critical for validation), contact discovery quality
- **Remove:** BUY/SELL classification, deep water hazards analysis, buying signals categorization, event program

**Architecture Decision:**
- Keep V1 available for future comprehensive enrichment needs
- V2 becomes primary prompt for current targeting/categorization workflow
- Both prompts maintained in `/prompts/` directory

**V2 Prompt Testing (Completed):**
- ‚úÖ Created V2 prompt manually (5 focused sections, ~100 lines)
- ‚úÖ Tested on 3 courses with different tiers/ownership:
  1. **Cape Fear National** (Leland, NC) - Premium private, Heritage Golf Group
  2. **The Neuse Golf Club** (Clayton, NC) - Premium semi-private, independent owner
  3. **Eagle Ridge** (Raleigh, NC) - Mid public/semi-private, recent ownership change

**V2 Test Results:**
| Course | Tier | Water Hazards | Volume Est. | Contacts Found | Contact Quality |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Cape Fear | Premium | Yes (18/18 holes) | 22k-32k | 4 (Owner entity, GM, Super, Head Pro) | Good (GM email/LinkedIn, Super GCSA-verified, Head Pro email) |
| Neuse | Premium | No (1-3 holes) | 35k-45k | 4 (Owner, Super, Head Pro, Ops) | Excellent (Owner direct phone, Head Pro direct email, Super LinkedIn) |
| Eagle Ridge | Mid | Yes (8-10 holes) | 35k-45k | 3 (Owner family, GM, Head Pro) | Fair (Main line only, recent ownership change limits public data) |

**Data Quality Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ All 5 sections complete with inline citations
- ‚úÖ Tier classifications accurate (Premium/Mid correctly identified)
- ‚úÖ Water hazard assessments detailed with hole-by-hole evidence
- ‚úÖ Volume estimates reasonable (triangulated from benchmarks)
- ‚úÖ Contact discovery: 3-4 decision makers per course
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email quality varies by course's public transparency (realistic limitation)

**Key Findings:**
1. **V2 delivers business requirements** - Premium/Mid/Budget, water hazards, volume, contacts, intelligence all present
2. **Citations consistent** - 100% of claims sourced with URLs
3. **Contact variance is expected** - Recent ownership changes, private clubs, and family-owned operations naturally limit public contact data
4. **Simpler parsing** - Flat 5-section structure vs V1's nested 8 sections

**Decision: V2 Approved for Production**
- V2 becomes primary prompt for enrichment workflow
- Manual testing validated quality without automated infrastructure overhead
- Ready for Phase 2: Contact enrichment via Apollo/Hunter agents

**Blockers/Questions:**
- None currently

**Next Actions (Phase 2.0):**
1. Set up Supabase table for V2 JSON results
2. Create Render parser agents
3. Create edge function trigger for parsers
4. Validate field mapping in Supabase
5. Test manual ‚Üí Render ‚Üí Supabase flow

**Phase 2.1:** Database cleanup (remove redundant tables)
**Phase 2.2:** Contact enrichment (Apollo/Render)

## üí° Lessons Learned

**Session 1:**
- Incremental approach (Option A) reduces risk
- LLM should do research, agents should do operations
- Citations critical for validating contact data
- Process incomplete data (tag for review) > discard

**Session 3:**
- Comprehensive != Better - V1's 8 sections were over-engineered for current needs
- Start with minimum viable data for automation, iterate if needed
- User feedback on "too extreme" prevented wasted testing effort
- Business requirements > Technical completeness (Premium/Mid/Budget ranking more valuable than BUY/SELL/BOTH for current workflow)
- Keep complex prompts archived for future use cases
- Manual testing with 3 diverse courses validated V2 faster than building automated infrastructure
- Contact discovery quality naturally varies by course's public data transparency (realistic, not a prompt failure)
- V2's 5-section flat structure significantly simpler to parse than V1's nested 8 sections
