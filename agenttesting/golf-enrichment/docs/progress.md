# Golf Enrichment v2 - Progress Tracking

**Project:** Enhanced enrichment workflow with BUY/SELL opportunity classification
**Started:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress - Phase 1 (LLM Research Agent)

---

## 📍 Current Phase

**Phase 1: LLM Research Agent**
- Goal: Single LLM call returns ALL course intelligence with citations
- Status: Planning → Implementation

## 🎯 Session Log

### Session 1 - October 31, 2025

**Completed:**
- ✅ Ideated buy/sell opportunity classification strategy
- ✅ Defined 4-phase architecture (LLM → Enrichment → Organization → ClickUp)
- ✅ Created tracking documentation structure

**Decisions Made:**
1. **LLM does heavy lifting** - Research, classification, extraction (not just prompt engineering)
2. **Agents stay focused** - Email finding (Apollo/Hunter), data merging, syncing
3. **Test both output formats** - Markdown vs JSON, pick winner based on parsing quality
4. **Scoring in Organizer** - Deterministic math, not LLM (easier to adjust weights)
5. **Process incomplete data** - Tag 'needs_human_review', don't lose leads

**Blockers/Questions:**
- None currently

**Next Session Goals:**
1. Build LLM Research Agent with enhanced 8-section prompt
2. Test markdown vs JSON output format on 1 test course
3. Validate classification accuracy on 3 test courses (BUY, SELL, BOTH)

## 🎯 Success Metrics (Running Tally)

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Classification Accuracy | 100% (3 test courses) | - | 🟡 Not tested |
| Email Discovery Rate | ≥70% | - | 🟡 Not tested |
| End-to-End Success | 5/5 courses complete | 0/5 | 🟡 Not started |
| LLM Citations Present | 100% | - | 🟡 Not tested |

## 💡 Lessons Learned

**Session 1:**
- Incremental approach (Option A) reduces risk
- LLM should do research, agents should do operations
- Citations critical for validating contact data
- Process incomplete data (tag for review) > discard
