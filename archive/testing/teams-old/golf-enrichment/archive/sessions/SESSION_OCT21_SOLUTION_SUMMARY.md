# Agent 4 Solution Summary - October 21, 2025

## üéØ Problem Solved: BrightData LinkedIn Scraping

**Issue:** Agent 4 returned HTTP 400 when trying to scrape LinkedIn profiles
**Impact:** 0% tenure coverage (should be 80%)
**Root Cause:** Wrong API endpoint and configuration

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: BrightData Hosted HTTP MCP

### The Discovery

**What DOESN'T Work:**
- ‚ùå stdio MCP: `{"type": "stdio", "command": "npx", "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"]}`
- ‚ùå Custom SDK tools with BrightData REST API (trigger+poll)
- ‚ùå Direct API calls to `https://api.brightdata.com/request`

**What WORKS:**
- ‚úÖ Hosted HTTP MCP: `{"type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.brightdata.com/mcp?token=..."}`
- ‚úÖ Tools: `search_engine` + `scrape_as_markdown`
- ‚úÖ Instant results (no polling needed)

### Implementation

```python
# Agent 4 configuration
bright data_hosted_mcp = {
    "type": "http",
    "url": f"https://mcp.brightdata.com/mcp?token={os.getenv('BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN')}"
}

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    mcp_servers={"brightdata": brightdata_hosted_mcp},
    allowed_tools=[
        "mcp__brightdata__search_engine",
        "mcp__brightdata__scrape_as_markdown"
    ]
)
```

## üìä Test Results (Local)

| Contact | LinkedIn | Tenure | Additional Fields |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Dustin | ‚úÖ Found | ‚úÖ 6.83 years | ‚úÖ 6/6 fields |
| John Stutz | ‚úÖ Found | ‚úÖ 0.58 years | ‚úÖ 6/6 fields |

**Comprehensive data extracted:**
1. Full job title
2. Company name
3. Previous golf/hospitality roles
4. Total industry experience
5. Education background
6. Certifications

**Cost:** ~$0.02 per contact (under budget!)

## üß™ Testing Methodology (Following SOP)

### Stage 2: MCP Testing ‚úÖ
- Validated BrightData MCP in Claude Code
- Tested hosted HTTP MCP in minimal SDK agent
- Confirmed comprehensive data extraction possible

### Stage 4: Local Validation ‚úÖ
- Tested Dustin (6.83 years, 19.58 industry years)
- Tested John Stutz (0.58 years, 20+ years experience)
- Both paths working with full data

### Stage 6: Docker Testing (IN PROGRESS)
- Building Docker image now
- Will test Course 142 (Country Club of Fairfax)
- Validate Agent 4 called in logs
- Validate comprehensive data in test database

### Stage 7: Production Deployment (PENDING)
- Only deploy if Docker passes
- Following Pattern 15 properly this time!

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. Hosted HTTP MCP vs stdio MCP

**Discovery:** BrightData has TWO ways to use their MCP:
- stdio: `npx @brightdata/mcp` (doesn't work in SDK)
- Hosted HTTP: `https://mcp.brightdata.com/mcp?token=...` (works perfectly!)

**Pattern:** If MCP works in Claude Code, use hosted HTTP endpoint in SDK agents

### 2. Comprehensive Data Extraction

**Same API call cost, extract ALL valuable data:**
- Tenure (original goal)
- Full title, company, previous roles
- Industry experience, education, certifications
- 10x value, 0x cost increase

### 3. Follow The SOP!

**What happens when we skip Stage 6:**
- Deploy broken code (missing env var crashes silently)
- No validation of orchestrator integration
- Production issues that Docker would catch

**Lesson:** Stage 6 exists for a reason - DON'T SKIP IT!

## üìÅ Files Modified

**Agent 4:** `teams/golf-enrichment/agents/agent4_linkedin_finder.py`
- Removed: 200+ lines of buggy custom SDK tools
- Added: Hosted HTTP MCP configuration
- Added: Comprehensive data extraction (6 new fields)
- Added: Error handling for missing BRIGHTDATA_API_TOKEN

**Testing Framework:**
- Pattern 15: Representative Test Data Coverage
- STAGE6: Step 3.5 test data validation
- STAGE7: Pre-deployment code coverage audit
- Example 6: Docker passed/Production failed case study

**Documentation:**
- `FINDINGS_MCP_SDK_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete testing journey

## üöÄ Next Steps (Stage 6 ‚Üí Stage 7)

### Stage 6: Docker Testing (30 min)
```bash
docker-compose up

# Test Course 142
curl -X POST localhost:8000/enrich-course \
  -d '{"course_name": "Country Club of Fairfax", "state_code": "VA", "use_test_tables": true}'

# Validate in logs:
‚úÖ Agent 4: Finding LinkedIn + Tenure
‚úÖ mcp__brightdata__search_engine called
‚úÖ mcp__brightdata__scrape_as_markdown called
‚úÖ Comprehensive data extracted

# Check database:
SELECT * FROM test_golf_course_contacts WHERE golf_course_id = ...;
```

### Stage 7: Production (ONLY if Docker passes!)
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Agent 4 comprehensive LinkedIn data extraction"
git push origin main

# Monitor Render deployment
# Test Course 133
# Validate 3-4/4 contacts with comprehensive data
```

---

## üí° SOP Updates Needed

### Add to STAGE6_DOCKER_TESTING.md:

**Step 2.5: Environment Variable Validation**
```markdown
Before Docker build:
‚ñ° All required env vars in docker-compose.yml
‚ñ° Agents handle missing optional vars gracefully
‚ñ° Test with empty .env to verify error handling
```

### Add to STAGE7_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md:

**STOP! Did You Complete Stage 6?**
```markdown
‚ùå Do NOT deploy if:
- Haven't run Docker test
- Docker logs don't show all agents running
- Any agent fails silently
- Comprehensive data not validated

Stage 6 exists to catch integration issues!
```

---

**Status:** Docker building, ready for Stage 6 testing with Course 142
**Next:** Docker test ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Deploy (following SOP!)
