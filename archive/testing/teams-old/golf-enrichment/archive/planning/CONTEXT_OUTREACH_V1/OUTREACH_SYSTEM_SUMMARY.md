## The Game-Changer: Landing Pages + Forms

### Old Approach (Email-Only):
```
Email (200 words) → Wait for reply → Parse response → Qualify manually
  ↓
1,000 emails → 100 opens → 8 replies → 4 qualified = 0.4% conversion
```

### New Approach (Email + Landing Page + Form):
```
Email (50 words) → Landing page → Form (6 questions) → Agent qualifies
  ↓
1,000 emails → 250 opens → 100 page visits → 60 form fills →
  → Agent 14 analyzes:
      18 HOT (30%) → Steve
      24 WARM (40%) → Sales
      12 NURTURE (20%) → Marketing
      6 INFO (10%) → Archive

= 42 qualified leads = 4.2% conversion

15X IMPROVEMENT!
```
