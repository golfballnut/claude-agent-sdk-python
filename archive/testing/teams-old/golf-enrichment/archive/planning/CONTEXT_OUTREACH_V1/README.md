## Quick Reference

### What We're Building

**The Problem:**
- 170 outreach tasks in backlog
- 10 manual emails/day (2-3 hours work)
- 30% follow-up completion
- 0.4% conversion to qualified leads

**The Solution:**
- 14 intelligent agents (8 enrichment + 6 outreach)
- Email ‚Üí Landing page ‚Üí Form ‚Üí AI qualification ‚Üí Auto-routing
- 50 automated emails/day (30 min work)
- 90%+ follow-up completion
- 4.2% conversion to qualified leads

**The Impact:**
- 15X more qualified leads (60/month vs 4/month)
- 94% cost reduction ($477/mo vs $5,000/mo)
- 90% time savings (20 hrs/mo vs 200 hrs/mo)

---

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1:** Build core agents (9, 10A, 10B, 11, 12)
- **Week 2:** Test with 100 courses (manual approval mode)
- **Week 3:** Add landing pages (Agents 10.5, 13, 14)
- **Week 4:** Scale to 50/day (hybrid mode)
- **Week 5+:** Full automation (production mode)
