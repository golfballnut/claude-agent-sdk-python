═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 💎 WHY RANGE BALL BUY PROGRAM (9/10 SCORE)

### **Buying Signals (Why This Fits):**

1. ✅ **High-End Positioning** → Discards worn balls for quality
2. ✅ **Massive Volume** → 30K inventory, 800K balls/year = huge supply
3. ✅ **6-Month Replacement** → Predictable, consistent supply
4. ✅ **Recent Facility Investments** → Sustainability mindset likely
5. ✅ **Premium Member Base** → Won't tolerate worn balls
6. ✅ **Multiple Ranges** → Ongoing need, not one-time

### **Key Pain Points We Solve:**

**Current State (Their Problem):**
- Disposing of 15,000+ used balls every 6 months
- Waste disposal costs
- Environmental impact (balls to landfill)
- Lost potential revenue

**Our Solution:**
- We BUY their used balls (turns waste → revenue)
- Handle pickup & sorting (zero hassle)
- Only take balls they're already discarding
- Sustainability story for members/marketing

### **Expected Value:**
**Conservative Estimate:**
- 15,000 balls every 6 months = 30,000/year
- At $0.50/ball purchase price = $15,000/year revenue FOR THEM
- Plus: Waste disposal cost savings
- Plus: Sustainability marketing value

### **Expected Objections & Responses:**

**"How much do you pay?"**
→ Based on volume and quality, typically $0.40-0.60 per ball. For your volume (30K/year), we'd structure a premium rate at the high end.

**"What's the quality threshold?"**
→ We only want balls <50% worn - the same balls your members were using before they showed wear. If it's good enough for CCV members, it's good enough to recondition.

**"Logistics and hassle?"**
→ We handle everything: pickup, sorting, grading. You just set aside used balls in designated area. Quarterly pickup works well for most clubs.

**"What if we sell them ourselves?"**
→ You could, but reconditioning requires specialized equipment ($500K+). We're the only company with the protective coating technology. Partnership is more profitable than DIY.

- Tone: Consultative, research-driven

- Why: Busy executives need reminders
- Angle: Specific numbers (30K balls/year value)
- Add: Case study or testimonial

**Step 3: LinkedIn (7 days)**
- Why: Different channel gets attention
- Angle: Brief message, reference email
- Goal: "Did you see my email about range balls?"

**Step 4: CC Warren (10 days)**
- Why: Loop in Director of Golf (operational owner)
- Angle: Both see value, can discuss together
- Goal: Someone responds

**Step 5: Phone Call (14 days)**
- Why: Human touch, build rapport
- Angle: "Following up on email/LinkedIn..."
- Goal: Just have conversation, not sell on call

**If All Fail:** Move to nurture (6-month follow-up)

---

### **Alternative Contacts (If Phil Unresponsive):**

**Try Warren West (Director of Golf):**
- Same opportunity, different angle
- Focus on operations/range management
- Subject: "Warren - Range Operations Question"

**Try Christian (Superintendent) for Retrieval:**
- Pivot to ball retrieval opportunity instead
- 7 water hazards = $10K+ annual retrieval value
- Easier "yes" than range ball buy

## 📧 EMAIL DRAFT (Ready to Customize & Send)

**To:** phil.kiester@theccv.org
**From:** {Your Name} <{your@email.com}>
**Subject:** CCV + Range Ball Revenue Opportunity | Quick Question

---

Hi Phil,

I noticed CCV's commitment to quality with your recent golf performance center investment—very impressive facility upgrades!

Quick question: Are you currently disposing of used range balls once they show wear, or have you explored recycling programs that could turn that waste into revenue?

We work with premium Virginia clubs to purchase their used range balls (the ones they're already discarding). Based on CCV's volume—roughly 30,000 balls replaced annually—this could generate $15,000+ per year while reducing waste.

We're the only company worldwide with the technology to recondition used balls to like-new quality with our protective coating, so there's real demand for what you're currently throwing away.

Would a brief 15-minute call make sense to explore if this fits CCV's operations?

Best regards,
{Your Name}
{Title}
{Phone}

P.S. We also handle ball retrieval for your water hazards (I see you have 7 on property) if that's ever of interest—another revenue stream many clubs appreciate.

---

**Customization Notes:**
- Add personal touch in opening (something specific about CCV you noticed)
- Adjust numbers if you have more precise data
- Change "15-minute call" to "quick conversation" if less formal
- P.S. is optional but plants seed for retrieval upsell
