# Test Findings: Apollo Failures & Hunter Fallback Strategy
**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Test:** `test_hunter_fallback_integration.py`
**Goal:** Understand why Apollo failed on 5 courses and validate Hunter.io fallback

---

## Key Finding: Apollo CAN Find These Courses!

**Test Result:** Apollo found contacts for all 3 courses when searching by **domain** ‚úÖ

```
Cardinal Country Club (playcardinal.net)     ‚Üí 9 contacts found
Carolina Club, The (thecarolinaclub.com)     ‚Üí 9 contacts found
Carolina, The (pinehurst.com)                ‚Üí 9 contacts found
```

**But production failed on these same courses** ‚ùå

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Production vs Test Search Strategy

**Production Code (agent2_apollo_discovery.py:121):**
```python
"q_organization_name": course_name,  # Searches by company name
```

**Test Code:**
```python
"organization_domain": domain,  # Searches by domain
```

### Why Production Failed

1. **Name Matching Issues**
   - "Carolina Club, The" vs "The Carolina Club" (article position)
   - "Carolina, The" vs "The Carolina" (name ambiguity)
   - Apollo's org name database may not match our course names exactly

2. **Missing Domains (2 courses)**
   - Carolina Colours Golf Club: No domain provided
   - Carolina Plantation Golf Club: No domain provided
   - Agent 1 was skipped (logs show "SKIPPED - NC course")

---

## Test Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Courses tested** | 3 (with domains) |
| **Apollo success** | 3/3 (100%) when searching by domain |
| **Hunter fallback triggered** | 0 (Apollo succeeded) |
| **Courses skipped** | 2 (no domains provided) |

### Cost Analysis
- Average cost per course: $0.092 (Apollo only)
- Hunter fallback cost (if triggered): +$0.049
- Combined max cost: $0.141 (still under $0.20 target)

---

## Recommendations to Reach 90% Success

### Priority 1: Fix Apollo Search Strategy (Immediate - Biggest Impact)

**Options:**

**A. Try domain-first search (RECOMMENDED)**
```python
# If domain available, search by domain FIRST
if domain:
    search_payload = {"organization_domain": domain, ...}
else:
    search_payload = {"q_organization_name": course_name, ...}
```

**Impact:** Should fix 3/5 failures (60%) immediately
**Cost:** $0 (no new APIs)
**Effort:** 30 minutes

**B. Name variant fallback**
```python
# Try variations if first search fails:
variants = [
    course_name,                          # "Carolina Club, The"
    course_name.replace(", The", ""),     # "Carolina Club"
    course_name.replace(", The", " The"), # "Carolina Club The"
    # Swap article to front
]
```

**Impact:** Might catch name matching edge cases
**Effort:** 1 hour

---

### Priority 2: Fix Domain Discovery (2 courses)

**Issue:** Agent 1 was "SKIPPED" but domains are still missing

**From logs:**
```
üîç [1/5] Agent 1: SKIPPED (NC course - using provided domain)
Domain: Not provided  ‚Üê Problem!
```

**Fix:** Don't skip Agent 1 if domain is truly missing
- Check if domain exists before skipping
- Run Agent 1 (domain finder) for courses without domains
- This fixes 2/5 failures

**Impact:** +40% success
**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Files:** `teams/golf-enrichment/orchestrator_apollo.py`

---

### Priority 3: Add Hunter.io Fallback (Belt & Suspenders)

**When to trigger:**
```python
if len(apollo_contacts) == 0 and domain:
    # Try Hunter.io Domain-Search
    hunter_contacts = await hunter_domain_search(domain)
```

**Impact:** +10-20% success (catches edge cases)
**Cost:** +$0.049/course when triggered
**Effort:** 2 hours

**Implementation:**
1. Add `hunter_domain_search()` function to Agent 2
2. Call after Apollo returns 0 results
3. Filter Hunter results (90%+ confidence, relevant titles)
4. Track source ("apollo" vs "hunter")

---

### Priority 4: Website Scraping (Final Fallback)

**When:** Both Apollo + Hunter return 0 contacts

**Strategy:**
1. Use Firecrawl to scrape course website
2. Find staff/contact pages
3. Extract emails via regex
4. Validate with email verifier

**Impact:** +5-10% success (handles small courses not in databases)
**Cost:** Variable (Firecrawl credits)
**Effort:** 4 hours

---

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Week 1: Quick Wins (Get to 80-90%)

1. **Fix Apollo search** (30 min)
   - Add domain-first search strategy
   - Test on 3 failed courses
   - Validate success rate improvement

2. **Fix domain discovery** (30 min)
   - Don't skip Agent 1 if domain missing
   - Test on 2 courses without domains
   - Validate domains are found

3. **Test combined improvements** (1 hour)
   - Run full orchestrator on all 5 failed courses
   - Measure new success rate
   - **Goal: 4/5 or 5/5 success (80-100%)**

### Week 2: Fallback Safety Net (Get to 90%+)

4. **Add Hunter fallback** (2 hours)
   - Implement in Agent 2
   - Test on edge cases
   - Track costs

5. **Test 10-course sample** (1 hour)
   - Mix of easy, medium, hard courses
   - Validate 90%+ success
   - Confirm costs < $0.20/course

### Future: Full Coverage (Get to 95%+)

6. **Website scraping fallback** (4 hours)
   - Implement Firecrawl scraper
   - Add email extraction
   - Test on small courses

## Cost Impact Analysis

**Current (44% success):**
- Cost per success: $0.21 ($0.092 √∑ 0.44)
- Wasted cost per failure: $0.092

**After fixes (projected 90% success):**
- Cost per success: $0.10-$0.15
- Much lower waste
- Better ROI

**Fallback costs:**
| Service | Cost | When Triggered | Impact |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|
| Apollo | $0.092 | Always (primary) | 50-60% success |
| Hunter | $0.049 | Apollo = 0 results | +20-30% success |
| Firecrawl | $0.02-0.05 | Both fail | +5-10% success |
| **Max total** | **$0.19** | Worst case | 90%+ success |

Still under $0.20 target ‚úÖ
