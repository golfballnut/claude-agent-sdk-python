# Teams Golf Enrichment Archive - October 30, 2025

> **Archive Location:** `archive/teams-2025-10-30/` (consolidated October 30, 2025)

## Purpose

This archive contains the complete `teams/golf-enrichment/` folder as it existed on October 30, 2025, before the testing infrastructure reorganization.

**Archive Date:** October 30, 2025
**Archive Reason:** Testing infrastructure cleanup and reorganization
**New Location:** `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/`
**Archive Path:** `archive/teams-2025-10-30/` (moved from root for consolidation)

## What Happened

The testing infrastructure was reorganized to:
1. Create a clean, Docker-first testing environment
2. Reduce file count from 81 to 45 essential files (44% reduction)
3. Separate active testing files from historical/archived material
4. Improve clarity for new contributors

## Contents

### complete-teams-folder/
Full backup of the original `teams/golf-enrichment/` directory structure, preserving all files including:
- All agent implementations (agents/)
- All orchestrators (orchestrator.py, orchestrator_apollo.py)
- All test files (testing/, test_*.py)
- All documentation (docs/, testing/docs/)
- All Docker configurations
- All archived material
- All results and data

## What Was Migrated

The following essential files were migrated to `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/`:

### Production Code (26 files)
- 11 agent files (agent1 through agent8, plus variants)
- 2 orchestrators (standard + Apollo)
- 1 API wrapper
- 2 utility files (env_loader, json_parser)
- Configuration files (requirements.txt, .env.example, .gitignore, README.md)

### Tests (8 files)
- 2 unit tests (test_agent1, test_apollo_validation)
- 1 integration test (test_contact_waterfall_full)
- 5 pipeline tests (test_final_pipeline, test_apollo_*)

### Test Infrastructure (11 files)
- 5 Docker configs
- 3 test scripts
- 4 test data files

### Documentation (3 files)
- SESSION_SUMMARY_OCT30.md
- APOLLO_DEBUG_HANDOFF_OCT30.md
- README.md

**Total Migrated: 45 files**

## What Was Archived (Not Migrated)

### Historical Testing Work (~35+ files)
- Email enrichment research (16 test files + docs) - work completed Oct 29-30
- Old agent tests (9 files) - replaced by Apollo implementation
- Monitoring tests (9 files) - operational, not essential for core testing
- Redundant root test files (5 files) - duplicates
- Historical Docker configs/results (7 files) - outdated test results
- Already-archived material (teams/archive/, testing/archive/)

These files remain in this archive for historical reference but are not needed for active Docker testing.

## How to Reference Archived Material

If you need to reference historical work:

1. **Email Enrichment Research:**
   See: `complete-teams-folder/testing/email-enrichment/`

2. **Old Agent Implementations:**
   See: `complete-teams-folder/agents/` (especially agent2, agent3, agent4 before Apollo)

3. **Historical Test Results:**
   See: `complete-teams-folder/testing/docker/` for old Docker test outputs

4. **Session Notes:**
   See: `complete-teams-folder/archive/sessions/`

5. **Planning Documents:**
   See: `complete-teams-folder/archive/planning/`

## Migration Log

See `MIGRATION_LOG.md` for detailed file-by-file mapping of what moved where.

## Restoration (If Needed)

To restore the original structure:

```bash
# CAUTION: This will overwrite agenttesting/
cp -r teams-golf-enrichment-archive-2025-10-30/complete-teams-folder /path/to/restore/
```

## Key Achievements Preserved

This archive captures the state after achieving:
- **80% automated success rate** (4/5 courses with verified contacts)
- **$0.052 cost per course** (74% under $0.20 budget)
- **100% data validation** (zero bad contacts)
- **5-tier enrichment cascade** (Apollo, Hunter, Jina, patterns)

All of this work is now in production at: `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/`

## Questions?
