**Performance:**
- Email Success: 50% (6/12 contacts via Hunter.io)
- LinkedIn Success: 25% (3/12 bonus from Hunter.io!)
- Cost: $0.0116/contact (42% under budget)
- Confidence: 95-98% when found

- No extra cost for LinkedIn data
- 50% of emails also include LinkedIn URLs
- **Agent 4 not needed** - One agent does both!

---

## Agent 4: LinkedIn Finder ❌ CANCELLED

**Reason:** Hunter.io Email-Finder includes `linkedin_url` field!

**Discovery:**
- Tested Hunter.io MCP tool via Claude Code
- Found linkedin_url in response (undocumented feature!)
- 50% of successful email lookups also return LinkedIn
- No extra API call or cost needed
