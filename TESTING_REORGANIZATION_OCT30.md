# Testing Infrastructure Reorganization - October 30, 2025

## What Changed

The agent testing infrastructure has been reorganized for clarity and maintainability.

### Old Structure ❌
```
teams/golf-enrichment/  (81 files, mixed testing + historical)
```

### New Structure ✅
```
agenttesting/golf-enrichment/  (45 essential files, clean organization)
```

## Quick Start

### Run Docker Tests
```bash
cd agenttesting/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.apollo.yml up --build

# In another terminal
cd agenttesting/golf-enrichment
bash scripts/test_apollo_fixes.sh
```

### Check API Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

## New Locations

| What | Old Location | New Location |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Docker configs** | `teams/golf-enrichment/` (root) | `agenttesting/docker/` |
| **Agent code** | `teams/golf-enrichment/agents/` | `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/agents/` |
| **Orchestrators** | `teams/golf-enrichment/` (root) | `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/orchestrators/` |
| **Tests** | `teams/golf-enrichment/testing/` + root | `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/tests/` (organized by type) |
| **Test scripts** | `teams/golf-enrichment/testing/docker/` | `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/scripts/` |
| **Test data** | `teams/golf-enrichment/testing/data/` | `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/data/` |
| **Results** | Mixed locations | `agenttesting/golf-enrichment/results/` (gitignored) |

## What Was Archived

Historical and redundant files are consolidated in:
- **Archive Location:** `archive/teams-2025-10-30/`
- **Old teams/ folder:** `archive/teams-old/` (working copy snapshot)

**Note:** All archives have been moved to `archive/` for better organization. See `archive/README.md` for details.

See archive for:
- Email enrichment research (completed Oct 29-30)
- Old agent tests (replaced by Apollo)
- Historical Docker test results
- Monitoring tests
- Exploratory test files

## Benefits

1. **44% fewer files** - Only essential files for Docker testing
2. **Clear organization** - Docker configs in one place, tests organized by type
3. **Faster onboarding** - New developers find what they need in seconds
4. **Scalable** - Easy to add new teams (sales-outreach/, etc.)
5. **Docker-first** - All Docker configs at `agenttesting/docker/`

## Documentation

- **agenttesting/README.md** - Overview of new structure + quick start
- **agenttesting/golf-enrichment/docs/** - Team-specific documentation
- **archive/README.md** - Overview of all archives
