# Agent Workflow Testing Framework

## POC-Proven Development Methodology

A systematic approach to building, testing, and deploying multi-agent teams with confidence.

## 🎯 The Three-Stage Validation Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 1: LOCAL BASELINE (Ground Truth)         │

## 💡 Why This Methodology Works

### Traditional Approach (Slow & Expensive)

```
Edit code → Deploy Docker → Test → Find issues → Repeat
   ↓            ↓              ↓         ↓
  1 min      2-3 min        $0.12    Deploy again...

Result: 10+ deployments per session = 30+ minutes wasted
```

**Problems:**
- Slow feedback loop (2-3 min per Docker rebuild)
- Expensive ($0.12 per test × 10 tests = $1.20)
- Hard to debug (container logs limited)
- No baseline to compare against
- Guesswork about what's correct

---

### POC Methodology (Fast & Proven)

```
Edit code → Test locally → Establish baseline → One Docker test → Deploy
   ↓            ↓               ↓                    ↓
  1 min      10 sec          Save results       Compare & deploy

Result: 1-2 deployments per session = 5 minutes total
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **80%+ time savings** - Local testing in seconds
- ✅ **90%+ cost savings** - Local testing is free
- ✅ **Higher quality** - Baseline comparison catches issues
- ✅ **Easier debugging** - Full Claude Code visibility locally
- ✅ **Confidence** - Know expected output before Docker
- ✅ **POC validation** - Prove concept cheaply first

---

## 🚀 When to Use This Methodology

### ✅ Use for:

- Building new multi-agent teams
- Adding new agents to existing teams
- Changing agent logic or prompts
- Validating data quality
- Proving POC before scaling
- Debugging agent issues
- Cost optimization testing

### 📋 Especially When:

- Working with external APIs (Perplexity, Hunter.io, etc.)
- Multi-step workflows (8+ agents)
- Expensive operations (>$0.10 per run)
- Database writes (need validation)
- Complex data transformations

## 🔧 Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Local Baseline Runner

**File:** `teams/[team]/tests/local/run_baseline.py`

```python
async def run_local_baseline(entity_id, entity_name, ...):
    """
    Run all agents locally to establish expected baseline
    """
    # Import agents
    from agents.agent1 import ...
    from agents.agent2 import ...

    # Run each agent
    agent1_result = await agent1(...)
    agent2_result = await agent2(...)
    # ...

    # Save baseline
    baseline = {"agent_results": {...}, "summary": {...}}
    with open(f"tests/baselines/entity_{entity_id}_baseline.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(baseline, f)

    return baseline
```

---

### Step 2: Create Comparison Tool

**File:** `teams/[team]/tests/local/compare_to_docker.py`

```python
def compare_results(entity_id, tolerance=None):
    """
    Compare Docker results vs local baseline
    Returns pass/fail with detailed diff report
    """
    baseline = load_baseline(entity_id)
    docker = load_docker_results(entity_id)

    # Compare critical fields
    - Cost (within ±tolerance)
    - Count fields (exact match)
    - Classifications (exact or within tolerance)

    # Report
    if all_match_within_tolerance:
        print("✅ DOCKER MATCHES BASELINE")
        return {"pass": True}
    else:
        print("❌ DOCKER DIFFERS - FIX REQUIRED")
        return {"pass": False}
```

---

### Step 3: Create Slash Command

**File:** `.claude/commands/test-local.md`

```markdown
Test {{team}} agents locally for {{entity}} {{id}}

Run agents using Claude Code MCP to establish baseline.
Saves to tests/baselines/{{entity}}_{{id}}.json
```

**Usage:** `/test-local 93`

---

### Step 4: Create Team Testing Skill

**File:** `.claude/skills/[team]-testing/SKILL.md`

Team-specific testing procedures, validation checklists, audit queries.

See `.claude/skills/golf-testing/` for complete example.

---

## 📊 Quality Gates & Tolerances

### What Must Match Exactly (Zero Tolerance)

- ✅ Entity ID (correct record updated)
- ✅ Contact count
- ✅ Required fields populated
- ✅ No duplicate entities created

### What Can Vary (Within Tolerance)

- ⚠️ Cost: ±$0.02 acceptable (API pricing variance)
- ⚠️ Confidence scores: ±1 point (AI variance)
- ⚠️ Classifications: ±1 tier (AI interpretation)
- ⚠️ Water hazards: ±1 count (data source variance)

### Failure Criteria

**STOP and FIX if:**
- ❌ Docker costs > baseline + $0.05
- ❌ Contact count differs
- ❌ Wrong entity ID updated
- ❌ Required fields null in Docker but present in baseline
- ❌ Duplicate entities created

---

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

### Typical Development Session

```bash
# 1. Edit agent code in teams/
vim teams/golf-enrichment/agents/agent6.py

# 2. Test locally (10 seconds)
python teams/golf-enrichment/tests/local/run_baseline.py 93 "Course Name" VA
# Output: Expected cost $0.11, contacts: 2

# 3. If baseline looks good, test in Docker (2 min)
docker-compose up --build -d
curl ... -o /tmp/course93-docker.json

# 4. Compare (instant)
python teams/golf-enrichment/tests/local/compare_to_docker.py 93
# Output: ✅ PASS or ❌ FAIL with diff report

# 5. If Docker matches baseline → Deploy
python production/scripts/sync_to_production.py golf-enrichment
cd production/golf-enrichment
git push
```

**Total Time:** 15-20 minutes (vs 60+ minutes traditional approach)

---

## 💰 Cost & Time Analysis

### Golf Enrichment Example

**Traditional Approach (Oct 18 Session):**
- 10+ Docker deployments
- 2-3 min per deploy × 10 = 30+ minutes
- $0.12 per test × 10 = $1.20
- Total time: ~3 hours (with debugging)

**POC Methodology:**
- 1-2 local baseline tests = 20 seconds
- 1-2 Docker validation tests = 5 minutes
- 1 production deployment = 3 minutes
- Total time: 8-10 minutes
- Total cost: $0.12-0.24

**Savings:**
- Time: 80-90% reduction
- Cost: 80-90% reduction
- Confidence: Higher (baseline comparison)

---

## 🎓 Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Run local baseline FIRST before Docker
- ✅ Save all baselines for regression testing
- ✅ Compare Docker to baseline before deploying
- ✅ Document tolerance thresholds
- ✅ Test 3+ entities before production
- ✅ Use real data (from database)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip local testing (wastes Docker time)
- ❌ Deploy without baseline comparison
- ❌ Use fake test data
- ❌ Ignore tolerance violations
- ❌ Test only 1 entity
- ❌ Deploy after Docker fails comparison

---

## 📚 Example: Golf Enrichment Team

### Implementation

**Location:** `teams/golf-enrichment/tests/local/`

**Files Created:**
- `run_baseline.py` - Runs all 8 agents locally
- `compare_to_docker.py` - Compares Docker vs baseline

**Slash Command:** `/test-local 93`

**Team Skill:** `.claude/skills/golf-testing/SKILL.md`

### Usage Example

```bash
# Query course from database
mcp__supabase__execute_sql: SELECT id, course_name FROM golf_courses WHERE id = 93

# Run local baseline
python teams/golf-enrichment/tests/local/run_baseline.py 93 "Westlake Golf and Country Club" VA

# Expected output:
✅ Baseline saved
💰 Expected Cost: $0.1150
👥 Expected Contacts: 2
🔗 VSGA URL: https://vsga.org/courselisting/...

# Test in Docker
docker-compose up --build -d
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/enrich-course -d '{
  "course_id": 93,
  "course_name": "Westlake Golf and Country Club",
  "state_code": "VA",
  "use_test_tables": false
}' -o /tmp/course93-docker.json

# Compare
python teams/golf-enrichment/tests/local/compare_to_docker.py 93

# If pass → deploy
python production/scripts/sync_to_production.py golf-enrichment
```

### Results

**Local Baseline:** 10 seconds, $0 cost, establishes expected: $0.1150, 2 contacts
**Docker Test:** 150 seconds, $0.12 cost, actual: $0.1160, 2 contacts
**Comparison:** ✅ PASS (within $0.02 tolerance)
**Deploy:** Confident - validated twice

---

## 🔍 Debugging with Framework

### Scenario: Docker Cost Higher Than Expected

**Traditional:**
- Re-deploy Docker with logging
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Check logs
- Guess at issue
- Deploy again
- Repeat...

**With Framework:**
```
1. Check baseline: Expected $0.11
2. Check Docker: Actual $0.15
3. Run comparison: Shows Agent 6 cost diff
4. Test Agent 6 locally: Find it's making extra calls
5. Fix Agent 6 locally: Test again (10 sec)
6. New baseline: $0.10
7. One Docker test: $0.11 (matches!)
8. Deploy
```

**Time Saved:** 20+ minutes
**Deployments Saved:** 5-8 deploys

---

---

## 🔄 Continuous Validation

### Regression Testing

```bash
# Save baselines for important test cases
teams/my-team/tests/baselines/
├── entity_1_baseline.json
├── entity_5_baseline.json
└── entity_10_baseline.json

# After code changes, retest all baselines
for id in 1 5 10; do
  # Run Docker
  curl ... -o /tmp/entity${id}-docker.json

  # Compare
  python tests/local/compare_to_docker.py $id

  # All must pass
done
```

**Benefit:** Catch regressions before deployment

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Baseline Script Fails

**Check:**
- Agents import correctly from teams/
- .env file has all API keys
- MCP tools available

**Fix:**
- Verify sys.path includes teams folder
- Check agent file paths
- Test individual agents first

---

### Docker Doesn't Match Baseline

**Investigate:**
1. Check which fields differ (comparison report shows)
2. Is difference within acceptable AI variance?
3. Is Docker using outdated code?
4. Are environment variables different?

**Common Causes:**
- Docker building from production/ instead of teams/
- Missing .env variables in Docker
- Code not synced
- Docker cache (need rebuild)

---

### Comparison Tool Can't Find Files

**Check:**
- Baseline saved: `tests/baselines/entity_{id}_baseline.json`
- Docker results saved: `/tmp/entity{id}-docker.json`
- File paths correct in script

---

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Custom Tolerance Per Test

```python
# For high-variance agents
tolerance = {
    "cost": 0.05,  # More lenient
    "contacts": 1,  # Allow ±1 contact
}

report = compare_results(entity_id, tolerance)
```

### Multi-Entity Batch Testing

```bash
# Test multiple entities
for id in 93 98 103; do
  python tests/local/run_baseline.py $id "..."
  # Run Docker test
  python tests/local/compare_to_docker.py $id
done
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-agents.yml
- name: Run local baseline
  run: python teams/golf-enrichment/tests/local/run_baseline.py 1 "Test"

- name: Build Docker
  run: docker-compose up --build -d

- name: Test Docker
  run: curl ... -o /tmp/entity1-docker.json

- name: Compare results
  run: python teams/golf-enrichment/tests/local/compare_to_docker.py 1
```
