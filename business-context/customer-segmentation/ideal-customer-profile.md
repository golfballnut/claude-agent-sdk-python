## Qualifying Characteristics

### Must-Have (Deal Breakers if Missing)

**1. Practice Range** ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- Dedicated driving range (not just net)
- Minimum 30 stations
- Currently using practice balls (not members' own balls)

**Why Critical:**
- Range balls = PRIMARY entry point (buy OR sell)
- Universal opportunity (every range needs balls)
- Determines BUY opportunity (waste volume)
- Determines SELL opportunity (purchasing need)
- Fast close (1-2 weeks vs 4-8 for retrieval)

---

**2. Range Ball Opportunity Classification**
- Must be classifiable as BUY, SELL, or BOTH
- BOTH opportunities = highest priority
- No range = disqualify (wrong fit)

**Why Critical:**
- Determines entry strategy and campaign routing
- BUY/SELL require completely different messaging
- BOTH = full circle relationship potential

---

**3. Decision Maker Accessibility (Director of Golf Priority)**
- Can identify General Manager or Superintendent
- Contact information discoverable (email or phone)
- Not completely private (some public presence)

**Why Critical:**
- Can't sell if we can't reach them
- Ghosting private clubs = waste of resources
- Need entry point to start conversation

---

### High-Value Indicators (Not Required but Ideal)

**1. BOTH Opportunity (Buy + Sell Signals Present)**
- Shows waste disposal mentions AND purchasing pain
- Highest value (full circle potential)
- Priority routing to specialized campaign

**Why Valuable:**
- Easiest entry (buy first = zero friction)
- Highest LTV (dual revenue streams)
- Strongest lock-in (ongoing relationship)
- 80% conversion rate (buy → full circle)

---

**2. Water Hazards (FOR EXPANSION - Not Entry)**
- 3+ ponds/lakes on course
- At least 1 high-traffic hazard
- Estimated 2,000+ balls accumulating annually

**Why Valuable:**
- Retrieval service = expansion opportunity (6-12 months after entry)
- Additional revenue stream after relationship established
- Raw materials for processing

**Strategic Note:**
⚠️ Not used as primary entry point due to high competition and slow close

---

**3. Active Event Program**
- Host 10+ corporate outings annually
- Member-guest tournaments
- Charity events
- Weekend leagues

**Why Valuable:**
- Outing packages = additional revenue
- Multiple decision makers = expansion opportunities
- Events = cash flow (less price-sensitive)

---

**4. Quality-Conscious Culture**
- Course rankings/awards mentioned
- Recent renovation or improvement projects
- Professional staff (PGA, GCSAA credentials)
- Member satisfaction focus

**Why Valuable:**
- Willing to pay for quality (our 80% look-new advantage)
- Premium positioning = better margins
- Likely to appreciate our differentiation

---

**5. Multiple Decision Makers Identified**
- GM + Director of Golf + Superintendent all findable
- Professional associations (CMAA, PGA, GCSAA)
- LinkedIn profiles active

**Why Valuable:**
- Multiple entry points = higher success rate
- Cross-selling opportunities (different services → different buyers)
- Demonstrates professional operation

---

**6. Buying Signals Present**
- Recent complaints about ball quality/cost mentioned
- "Looking for supplier" language in job posts/minutes
- Budget discussions visible (municipal courses)
- Vendor changes mentioned

**Why Valuable:**

- High volume needed to justify effort
- Complex approval processes

**When to Target:**

- Templated proposals ready

---

### Ultra-Private/Exclusive Clubs

**Why Avoid:**
- Impossible to reach decision makers
- No public contact information
- Members-only everything
