- Case studies compelling

---

### Tier 4 Municipal (Early Stage)

**Why Avoid (For Now):**
- Lowest margins (price-sensitive)
- Slow procurement (government bureaucracy)
- High volume needed to justify effort
- Complex approval processes

**When to Target:**
- After workflow automated (low-touch sales model)
- Proven pricing model
- Volume economies of scale achieved
- Templated proposals ready

---

### Ultra-Private/Exclusive Clubs

**Why Avoid:**
- Impossible to reach decision makers
- No public contact information
- Members-only everything
- Referral/invitation only access

**Characteristics to Spot:**
- Zero online presence beyond name/location
