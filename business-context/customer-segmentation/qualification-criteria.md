## Links Choice-Specific Qualifiers

### Water Hazard Qualification

**Why Critical:**
Retrieval service = entry point + raw material source

**Scoring:**
- 7+ water hazards with ball accumulation: 10 points (A-tier)
- 4-6 water hazards: 7 points (B-tier)
- 1-3 water hazards: 3 points (C-tier)
- 0 water hazards: 0 points (Wrong fit, skip)

**Additional Context:**
- Island greens = premium (high ball loss)
- Lakeside holes = premium (high ball loss)
- Ponds on low-traffic holes = standard

**Discovery Priority:**
Ask LLM: "How many ponds, lakes, or water hazards on the course? Which holes have highest ball loss?"

---

### Range Size/Quality Qualification

**Why Critical:**
Range ball sales = primary revenue, subscription opportunity

**Scoring:**
- 50+ stations: 10 points (Subscription fit)
- 30-49 stations: 7 points (Range ball sales fit)
- 15-29 stations: 4 points (Small opportunity)
- <15 stations or no range: 0 points (Wrong fit)

**Additional Context:**
- "Range balls in poor condition" = buying signal
- "Recently renovated range" = quality-conscious
- "No range" = Pro shop balls only (different offering)

**Discovery Priority:**
Ask LLM: "Driving range size, number of stations, practice facilities"

---

### Course Tier Qualification

**Why Critical:**
Determines service offering and pricing strategy

**Scoring:**
- Tier 1 (Elite): 5 points (Hard to close, save for later)
- Tier 2 (Premium Private): 10 points (Sweet spot)
- Tier 3 (Mid-Market): 8 points (Volume play)
- Tier 4 (Budget): 5 points (Low margin, high volume)

**Additional Context:**
See `course-tiers.md` for detailed classification

**Discovery Priority:**
Ask LLM: "Green fees, membership type, annual rounds estimate"

---

### Decision Maker Access Qualification

**Why Critical:**
Can't sell if we can't reach them

**Scoring:**
- 4+ contacts with emails + LinkedIn: 15 points
- 3 contacts with emails: 12 points
- 2 contacts with emails: 8 points
- 1 contact with email: 5 points
- Phones only, no emails: 2 points
- No contacts found: 0 points (Disqualify)

**Contact Quality Tiers:**
- **Gold:** Work email + LinkedIn + phone + title verified
- **Silver:** Work email + title verified
- **Bronze:** Email (unverified) or phone only

**Discovery Priority:**
Ask LLM: "Find GM, Superintendent, Director of Golf with emails and LinkedIn"

---

### Pain Point Qualification

**Why Critical:**
Pain = urgency = faster close

**Scoring:**
- 3+ pain points identified: 15 points
- 2 pain points: 10 points
- 1 pain point: 5 points
- No pain points: 0 points

**Pain Point Categories:**
1. **Cost Pain:** "Budget cuts", "Practice balls too expensive", "Need cost savings"
2. **Quality Pain:** "Range balls in poor condition", "Members complaining"
3. **Operational Pain:** "Too many vendors", "Ponds need cleaning", "No disposal solution"
4. **Growth Pain:** "Expanding range", "Adding practice facilities", "Hosting more events"

**Discovery Priority:**
Ask LLM: "Recent challenges, complaints, budget constraints, improvement areas"

## Scoring Matrix

### How to Calculate Total Score

**Opportunity Size (40% weight):**
```
Water hazards (0-10 pts) × 0.15 = 0-1.5
Range size (0-10 pts) × 0.15 = 0-1.5
Course tier (0-10 pts) × 0.10 = 0-1.0
Total = 0-4.0 points
```

**Accessibility (30% weight):**
```
Decision makers found (0-15 pts) × 0.20 = 0-3.0
Contact quality (0-10 pts) × 0.10 = 0-1.0
Total = 0-4.0 points (but max 3.0 for weight)
```

**Buying Readiness (30% weight):**
```
Pain points (0-15 pts) × 0.15 = 0-2.25
Timing signals (0-10 pts) × 0.10 = 0-1.0
Budget indicators (0-5 pts) × 0.05 = 0-0.25
Total = 0-3.5 points (but max 3.0 for weight)
```

**Maximum Total Score:** 10.0 points

## Qualification Workflow

### Step 1: Automated Scoring (LLM → Supabase)

**After LLM discovery:**
```sql
UPDATE golf_courses SET
  qualification_score = CALCULATE_SCORE(
    water_hazards,
    range_size,
    course_tier,
    decision_makers_found,
    pain_points,
    buying_signals
  ),
  qualification_tier = CASE
    WHEN qualification_score >= 8.0 THEN 'A'
    WHEN qualification_score >= 6.0 THEN 'B'
    WHEN qualification_score >= 4.0 THEN 'C'
    ELSE 'D'
  END
WHERE course_id = ?;
```

---

### Step 2: ClickUp Sync (Tiered Lists)

**Create tasks in tier-specific lists:**
- Score 8.0+: "Hot Leads" list (immediate outreach)
- Score 6.0-7.9: "Qualified Leads" list (sequence)
- Score 4.0-5.9: "Nurture Leads" list (educational drip)
- Score <4.0: Don't create task (archive in Supabase)

---

### Step 3: Manual Review (Sales Discretion)

**Sales can override:**
- Move C-tier to B-tier if relationship exists
- Move B-tier to A-tier if urgent pain discovered
- Disqualify any tier if fundamentally wrong fit

**Document override reason in ClickUp**

---
