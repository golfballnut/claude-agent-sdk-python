## Executive Summary

Links Choice is a B2B golf ball processing company launching an AI-powered outreach program to systematically develop the Green Grass (golf course sales) channel. We have world-class golf ball processing capabilities (recycling + refinishing) that no other company can match, but haven't invested in systematic golf course outreach.

**The Opportunity:** 10,000+ golf courses in NC, SC, VA, GA

**The Challenge:** Manual outreach doesn't scale, generic contact lists miss decision makers

**The Solution:** AI-powered enrichment workflow that discovers contacts AND qualifies opportunities

## Enrichment Data Priorities

- Ball accumulation estimate (high/medium/low)
- Current retrieval service status

**Why:** Retrieval = entry point + raw materials + opportunity sizing

---

**2. Practice Range Size**
- Station count (50+ = subscription fit, 30+ = sales opportunity)
- Range type (grass/mat)
- Quality mentions ("poor condition", "need replacement")
- Current supplier

**Why:** Range balls = primary revenue, subscription opportunity assessment

---

**3. Decision Maker Contacts**
- GM/Owner (Priority 1: contract authority)
- Superintendent (Priority 1: retrieval decisions)

## Success Metrics (To Be Defined)

**Discovery Phase:**
- Contact discovery success rate: ≥70% (proven)
- Email verification rate: ≥90% (target)
- Avg contacts per course: ≥4 (target)
- Cost per course: ≤$0.05 (target)

**Qualification Phase:**
- % courses scoring A-tier: Target 15-20%
- % courses scoring B-tier or better: Target 40-50%
- Disqualification rate: Expected 15-20%

**Conversion Phase (TODO):**
- Close rate by tier
- Average deal size by tier
- Sales cycle length by tier
- Customer lifetime value

---

## Key Assumptions (To Validate)

1. **Water hazards predict retrieval opportunity** → Test with first 20 courses
2. **Range size predicts subscription fit** → Validate 50+ station threshold
3. **Tier 2 closes fastest** → Track close rates by tier
4. **Buying signals increase urgency** → Compare close time with/without signals
5. **Multiple decision makers increase success** → Track success rate by contact count

---
