## Service Menu - PRIORITIZED BY ENTRY POINT STRATEGY

### 1. Purchase Practice Balls ⭐ **BEST ENTRY POINT**

**Why #1 Entry Point:**
- ✅ Zero friction (we PAY them, not asking them to buy)
- ✅ 1-week close (simple purchase agreement)
- ✅ Instant trust (money in their account immediately)
- ✅ Natural upsell path (prove quality → sell to them)
- ✅ Less competitive (few companies offer to purchase)
- ✅ No pain required (they profit even without problems)

**What We Offer:**
Pay golf courses for practice balls they would normally throw away

**Customer Pain Point:**
- Courses collect worn/damaged range balls with nowhere to sell them
- Currently throwing away or stockpiling
- Lost revenue opportunity

**Our Solution:**

**Pricing:** TODO - Define per-ball or per-bucket pricing

**Entry Point Value:**

- Immediate revenue (no investment required)
- Foot in door for additional services

**Full Circle Strategy (BUY → SELL):**
```
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Purchase their waste balls
↓
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): Process to 80% look-new quality
↓
Phase 3 (Week 7): Show them the results
"These are YOUR balls after our process - impressive quality, right?"
↓
Phase 4 (Week 8+): Natural upsell
"Want us to supply your new range balls at this quality for 50% off new pricing?"
↓
Result: BOTH - We buy their waste + Supply their new balls = full circle
```

**Decision Maker:** Director of Golf (manages range ball inventory and disposal)

**Close Rate:** 60%+ for initial purchase, 80% conversion to full circle

### 4. Ball Retrieval Service - EXPANSION SERVICE (NOT Entry Point)

**Strategic Note:**
⚠️ **DO NOT use as primary entry point** due to:
- High competition ("many companies calling daily about test dives")
- Low perceived value ("not much money for big clubs")
- Slow sales cycle (4-8 weeks, complex approval)
- Multiple stakeholders (Superintendent + GM)

**When to Offer:**
- ✅ 6-12 months after range ball relationship established
- ✅ As bundle with subscription program
- ✅ After trust built via purchase or sales

**What We Offer:**
Professional water hazard ball retrieval service

**Customer Pain Point:**
- Thousands of balls accumulating in ponds/lakes
- Environmental/aesthetic concerns
- DIY retrieval is time-consuming/dangerous

**Our Solution:**
- Professional diving team
- Regular scheduled retrieval (monthly, quarterly, annual)

**Revenue Models:**
- **Option A:** We pay course for harvested balls
- **Option B:** Free retrieval service (we keep balls)
- **Option C:** Course keeps balls, pays retrieval fee

**Ideal For:**
Courses with 5+ water hazards, high traffic holes with island greens

**Decision Maker:**
Superintendent (water hazard maintenance) + GM (contract approval)

**Expansion Strategy:**
After we're already supplying range balls:
"By the way, we also do retrieval - want us to clean your ponds too?"

**Cross-Sell Value:**
Harvested balls → We buy them → Process → Sell back as range balls
