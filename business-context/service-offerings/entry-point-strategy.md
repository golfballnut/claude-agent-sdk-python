# Entry Point Strategy: Buy vs Sell Classification

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025
**Purpose:** Strategic framework for identifying and approaching golf course opportunities
**Key Insight:** BUY and SELL opportunities require completely different outreach strategies

---

## Executive Summary

Links Choice has **two distinct range ball opportunities** that must be identified and approached differently:

1. **BUY FROM Courses** - Purchase their waste practice balls
2. **SELL TO Courses** - Supply them with premium range balls
3. **BOTH** - Full circle opportunity (HIGHEST VALUE)

**Critical:** Using the wrong approach (selling to a buy opportunity or buying from a sell opportunity) results in missed opportunities and wasted outreach.

---

## The Three Opportunity Types

### 1. BUY Opportunities (We Purchase From Them)

**What It Is:**
Courses have worn/damaged practice balls they're discarding or storing with no recovery plan.

**Our Offer:**
"We'll pay you $X per ball for practice balls you're throwing away"

**Value Proposition to Course:**
- Turn waste into revenue
- Zero effort required
- Free pickup and payment
- Environmental benefit (disposal handled)

**Indicators Course is BUY Opportunity:**
- "Throwing away" old range balls
- "Storage full of old balls"
- "Just renovated range" (old inventory to clear)
- "Worn out practice balls"
- "Getting rid of" ball inventory
- "No market for our used balls"

**Course Characteristics:**
- Large range (50+ stations = high waste volume)
- Premium clubs (Tier 1-2 = higher quality waste)
- Long-established (years of accumulation)
- Recent range renovation (old inventory exists)

**Decision Maker:** Director of Golf OR Superintendent (whoever manages range inventory)

**Sales Cycle:** 1 week (simple purchase agreement)

**Competition Level:** LOW (few companies actively buy from courses)

**Entry Strategy:**
```
Week 1: Offer to purchase waste balls
Week 2: Pick up and pay
Week 3-6: Process their balls to 80% look-new
Week 7: Show results + "Want us to supply your new balls?"
Week 8+: Full circle relationship (buy waste + supply new)
```

---

### 2. SELL Opportunities (They Purchase From Us)

**What It Is:**
Courses need to buy practice balls and are experiencing budget pressure or quality issues.

**Our Offer:**
"Premium range balls at 50% off new pricing with 80% look-new quality"

**Value Proposition to Course:**
- 50% cost savings vs new balls
- Better quality than other recyclers (80% look-new)
- Consistent supply and quality
- Simplified procurement

**Indicators Course is SELL Opportunity:**
- "Practice ball budget too high"
- "Looking for ball supplier" or vendor search
- "Range balls in poor condition"
- "Members complaining about ball quality"
- "Current supplier too expensive"
- "Need to buy/order range balls"
- Budget constraints mentioned

**Course Characteristics:**
- Any tier (budget pressure universal)
- Quality-conscious (Tier 2-3 = member satisfaction focus)
- New range or renovation (need to stock inventory)
- Recent supplier changes (switching window)

**Decision Maker:** Director of Golf (range budget authority)

**Sales Cycle:** 1-2 weeks (fast if pain is acute)

**Competition Level:** MODERATE (other recyclers, new ball suppliers)

**Entry Strategy:**
```
Week 1: Outreach with cost savings pitch
Week 2: Send samples, quote
Week 3: First order (trial)
Week 4-8: Prove quality and reliability
Week 9+: Recurring relationship + expand to other services
```

---

### 3. BOTH Opportunities (Full Circle) ‚≠ê HIGHEST VALUE

**What It Is:**
Course shows BOTH waste disposal needs AND active purchasing needs.

**Example Indicators:**
- Large range (volume) + quality complaints
- "Throwing away old balls" + "Need new supplier"
- Premium club + budget pressure
- Range renovation + mentions old inventory

**Our Offer:**
"We'll buy your old balls AND supply your new ones at 50% off"

**Value Proposition to Course:**
- Immediate revenue (we buy waste)
- Cost savings (50% off new)
- Closed-loop solution (sustainability)
- Single vendor simplicity

**Why This is HIGHEST VALUE:**
- ‚úÖ **Easiest entry:** They make money first (zero friction)
- ‚úÖ **Built-in trust:** We pay them before asking for sale
- ‚úÖ **Proof of concept:** They see their balls transformed
- ‚úÖ **Natural upsell:** "Want balls at this quality? We can supply them"
- ‚úÖ **Maximum LTV:** Ongoing buy + sell = locked relationship
- ‚úÖ **Highest margin:** Raw materials + sales revenue

**Recommended Strategy:**
```
Phase 1: BUY FIRST (2-4 weeks)
- "We'll purchase your waste balls at $X per ball"
- Build trust, establish relationship
- Get paid to acquire raw materials

Phase 2: PROVE QUALITY (2-4 weeks)
- Process their balls to 80% look-new
- Show them before/after comparison
- "These are YOUR balls after our process"

Phase 3: SELL (Week 9+)
- "Want us to supply your new range balls at this quality?"
- Leverage trust from phase 1
- Natural conversion (they've seen proof)

Phase 4: FULL CIRCLE (Ongoing)
- Buy their waste continuously
- Supply their new balls continuously
- Add expansion services (retrieval, coating, subscription)
- Maximum customer lifetime value
```

**Decision Maker:** Director of Golf (controls both waste and purchasing)

**Sales Cycle:** 8-12 weeks (slower but highest value)

**Competition Level:** VERY LOW (almost no one offers full circle)

**Our Advantages:**
- üü¢ No friction - they profit immediately
- üü¢ Fast decision - 1 week
- üü¢ Trust building - we pay first
- üü¢ Proof of quality - their balls transformed
- üü¢ Natural upsell path

**Messaging:**
"Revenue opportunity: We'll pay you for balls you're discarding"

---

### Range Ball Sales (SELL) Entry

**Competition Level:** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è MODERATE

**Why:**
- Other recyclers exist
- Price competition
- New ball suppliers

**Our Advantages:**
- üü° 50% cost savings (clear ROI)
- üü° 80% look-new quality (differentiator vs other recyclers)
- üü° Faster than retrieval (1-2 weeks vs 4-8)
- üü° Universal need (every range)

**Challenges:**
- Need to prove quality (samples help)
- Price sensitive market
- Incumbent supplier relationships

**Messaging:**
"Save 50% on premium range balls (80% look-new quality)"

---

### Ball Retrieval Entry

**Competition Level:** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è HIGH

**Why:**
- "Lot of other companies calling courses daily"
- Commoditized service
- Low perceived value ("not much money for big clubs")

**Disadvantages:**
- üî¥ Slow close - 4-8 weeks
- üî¥ Complex approval - Superintendent + GM
- üî¥ Low urgency - aesthetic/maintenance (not revenue)
- üî¥ Hard to quantify value upfront

**Recommendation:** ‚ùå AVOID AS ENTRY POINT

**Use Instead As:**
