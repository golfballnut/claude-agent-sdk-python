**Status:** Initial framework - needs actual pricing data

## Pricing Philosophy

### Value-Based Pricing

**Core Principle:**
Price based on customer value received, not just our cost

**Customer Value Drivers:**
- Cost savings vs alternatives
- Revenue generation (retrieval, trade programs)
- Quality improvement (80% look-new recycled balls)
- Convenience (one-stop shop, turnkey solutions)
- Risk reduction (subscription model, guaranteed quality)

---

## Pricing by Service Type

### Ball Purchase Programs (We Buy From Courses) ⭐ **ENTRY POINT PRICING**

**Purpose:** Entry point strategy - pay courses for waste balls to build trust before selling

**Strategic Importance:**
- Zero friction entry (they make money immediately)
- Trust building before asking for sale
- Prove quality by processing their balls
- Natural upsell path to supply relationship

**Pricing Tiers by Ball Quality:**
- **Premium waste** (Tier 1-2 clubs, minimal damage): $0.15-0.25 per ball
- **Standard waste** (Tier 3 clubs, moderate wear): $0.10-0.15 per ball
- **Practice grade waste** (high wear, Tier 4): $0.05-0.10 per ball

**Volume Pricing (Higher volume = higher price per ball):**
- 1,000-5,000 balls: Base rate
- 5,000-10,000 balls: +$0.02 premium per ball
- 10,000+ balls: +$0.05 premium per ball
- One-time large cleanout: Custom pricing (negotiate)

**Strategic Pricing Rationale:**
```
Buy at: $0.15 per ball average
Processing cost: $0.10 per ball
Sell back at: $0.50 per ball (50% off $1.00 new)
Gross margin: $0.25 per ball (50%)
PLUS: Relationship value (ongoing buy + sell)
```

**Payment Terms:**
- Net-7 (pay within one week of pickup)
- Immediate payment for first transaction (trust building)
- Monthly billing for ongoing relationships

**Decision Maker:** Director of Golf or Superintendent (inventory manager)

**Close Rate Target:** 60%+ (low friction, they profit)

**Upsell Conversion Target:** 80% (from BUY to BOTH within 6 months)

---

### Retrieval Services (EXPANSION - Not Entry Pricing)

**Pricing Models:**

**Model A: Course Revenue**
- We pay course $X per ball retrieved
- Course generates revenue from "waste"
- We get raw materials for processing

**Model B: Free Service**
- We retrieve balls at no charge
- We keep all balls harvested
- Course saves on maintenance/aesthetics

**Model C: Split Harvest**
- We split balls 50/50 (or other ratio)
- Both parties benefit
- Flexible negotiation

**TODO: Define specific per-ball pricing by course tier**

**Selection Criteria:**
- High-end courses → Model A (they want revenue)
- Low-end courses → Model B (they want free service)
- Mid-tier courses → Model C (balanced approach)

---

### Range Ball Sales

**Base Pricing Framework:**

```
New premium practice balls: $X/dozen (market baseline)
    ↓
Other recyclers: $X*0.60/dozen (40% discount)
    ↓
Links Choice: $X*0.50/dozen (50% discount)
    ↓
Superior quality + better price = competitive advantage
```

**Volume Discounts:**
- 1,000-5,000 balls: Standard pricing
- 5,001-10,000 balls: 5% additional discount
- 10,001-20,000 balls: 10% additional discount
- 20,001+ balls: Custom pricing (negotiate)

**Quality Tiers:**
- **Premium Recycled:** $X*0.50 (80% look-new quality)
- **Standard Recycled:** $X*0.40 (good condition)
- **Practice Grade:** $X*0.30 (budget option)

**TODO: Define actual $ per dozen pricing**

---

### Protective Coating Service

**Pricing Logic:**
```
Cost to replace practice balls: $Y
    ↓
Cost of coating service: $Y*0.40 (40% of replacement)
    ↓
Ball life extension: 1+ season
    ↓
ROI: 2.5x (save $0.60 for every $0.40 spent)
```

**Pricing:**
- Per-ball coating fee: $Z
- Minimum order: 500 balls
- Bulk discount: 2,000+ balls get 10% off

**TODO: Define actual coating price per ball**

---

### Subscription Practice Program

**Monthly Fee Structure:**
```
Range size (stations) × average balls per station × quality tier
    ↓
50 stations × 100 balls × premium tier = 5,000 balls in rotation
    ↓
Monthly fee = (ball cost + logistics + swap labor) / 12 months
    ↓
Example: $X/month for 5,000-ball program
```

**Pricing Tiers:**
- **Premium:** Top-quality recycled balls, 2x/year swap
- **Standard:** Good-quality recycled balls, 2x/year swap
- **Budget:** Practice-grade balls, 1x/year swap

**Value Proposition Math:**
```
Traditional Model:
- Upfront purchase: 5,000 balls × $X/ball = $5,000
- Replacement: 2,500 balls × $X/ball = $2,500/year
- Total Year 1: $7,500

Subscription Model:
- Monthly fee: $400/month
- Annual cost: $4,800
- Savings: $2,700 (36%)
- Bonus: Always fresh balls, no inventory management
```

**TODO: Define monthly pricing by range size/tier**
