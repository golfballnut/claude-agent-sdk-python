      "Your query requests detailed, hole-by-hole information about water hazards at Richmond Country Club in Virginia, along with a visual scorecard and map. Here’s what the available public sources show, based on multiple searches and the club’s official website:\n\n## Official Scorecard PDF or Image with Water Hazard Symbols\n\n- **No official scorecard PDF or image with water hazard symbols is available on richmondcountryclubva.com**[4]. The site provides general info about amenities but does not publish a downloadable or interactive scorecard with hazard markings.\n- **No foretee.com, USGA course rating, or golf architecture review documents** are present in the search results, nor do these sources provide a direct scorecard with hazard notation.\n\n## Hole-by-Hole Descriptions Mentioning Water\n\n- **The club’s own scorecard/layout page does not provide hole-by-hole descriptions, let alone references to water hazards**[1]. Only yardages, par, and handicaps are listed for each hole across all tee sets.\n- **Third-party platforms like 18Birdies** show a basic scorecard (yardage, par, handicap), but no hole descriptions or hazard notes[2].\n- **No external golf course architecture reviews** mention water features at Richmond Country Club in the current search results.\n- **Detailed maps and yardage charts (ProVisualizer)** are referenced but do not display hazard symbols or descriptions in the search snippet[7].\n\n## Course Map Showing Ponds, Lakes, Creeks\n\n- **No interactive or static course map indicating water features is available in the search results** for Richmond Country Club, VA[4][1][7].\n- **ProVisualizer’s Richmond CC page** implies the ability to view course layout in detail, but no sample image or description of water hazards is shown in the search snippet[7].\n- **The club’s official course layout page** does not provide a map, only a numerical layout table[1].\n\n## Counting Water Features\n\n**Based on the available public data, it is impossible to determine how many holes at Richmond Country Club (VA) have water hazards (“pond”, “lake”, “creek”, or “water hazard”), because no hole descriptions or visual maps with hazard symbols are published online.**  \nThere is no mention of water on the club’s website or in the summary scorecards found in search results[1][2][4].\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Requested Item                      | Available in Search? | Notes                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scorecard PDF/image w/water symbols | No                   | Only numerical layout, no hazard symbols or images[1][4]                               |\n| Hole-by-hole water descriptions     | No                   | No descriptions published, only yardage/par/handicap[1][2]                             |\n| Course map with water features      | No                   | No map with water shown; ProVisualizer provides layouts, but no hazard details in snippet[7] |\n| Count of holes with water           | No                   | No data to determine this from public sources[1][2][4]                                 |\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Richmond Country Club in Virginia does not publish a detailed, hazard-marked scorecard, hole-by-hole descriptions, or a course map showing water features on its official website or in any searchable third-party sources.**  \nFor conclusive information—including which holes have water hazards and visual maps—you would need to contact the club directly or visit in person, as this level of detail is not available online[4].  \n**Based on the information currently accessible, the number of holes with water features cannot be counted.**",
