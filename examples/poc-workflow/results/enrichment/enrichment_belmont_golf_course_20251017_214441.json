      "The Belmont Golf Course in Richmond, VA, designed by A.W. Tillinghast and opened in 1938, does not have detailed public documentation specifying the exact number of holes with water hazards, ponds, lakes, or creeks. No course scorecards or specific water hazard symbols for this course were found in the available sources[5][7].\n\nHowever, there is a Belmont Country Club golf course in Ashburn, VA, which is an 18-hole Arnold Palmer Signature course known for its extensive water and wetland features. This course is described as having a \"vast amount of wetland hazards\" and natural elevation changes, including tree-lined fairways and many wetlands that challenge golfers. It was rated the third most challenging course in Virginia by the USGA. Though no exact count of water hazards is stated, it clearly features multiple wetlands, ponds, or creeks integrated throughout its layout[2][4][6].\n\nSeparately, The Osprey's Golf Club at Belmont Bay (not \"Belmont Golf Course\") in VA is mentioned to have several water hazards and narrow fairways with some forced carries over water, but specifics on the number of water hazards or bodies of water are not provided[1][3].\n\nIn summary:\n\n| Course Name                  | Location            | Water Hazards Summary                   | Exact Number of Water Hazards Reported |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Belmont Golf Course           | Richmond, VA        | No detailed info on water hazards found | Not specified                         |\n| Belmont Country Club          | Ashburn, VA         | Vast wetlands and water hazards; multiple ponds/creeks implied | Not specified                         |\n| Osprey's Golf Club at Belmont Bay | VA (nearby)       | Several water hazards, some forced carries over water | Not specified                         |\n\nNo exact number of water hazards on the Belmont Golf Course in Richmond, VA was identified from available sources. The Belmont Country Club in Ashburn VA has abundant wetlands but exact counts are unavailable.\n\nIf you are specifically referring to the Belmont Golf Course in Richmond, it appears water hazards are not prominently featured or documented. For the Belmont Country Club in Ashburn, expect significant wetland water hazards across many holes though exact totals are unpublished.",
