However, many golf courses typically include water hazards in their design, which are crucial for strategic play.\n\n## Course Map\n\nA detailed course map showing ponds, lakes, or creeks is not available from the sources provided. However, golf course maps generally highlight these features to help players navigate the course.\n\n## Water Features\n\nThe search results do not provide specific information on the number of holes with water features at Richmond Country Club in VA. Typically, golf courses vary in the number of water hazards they include, but often multiple holes are affected.\n\n**Water Features Count**: Without specific details, it's difficult to count exactly how many holes feature \"water hazard,\" \"pond,\" \"lake,\" or \"creek.\" This would require access to the course's official map or detailed scorecard, which is not available from the given sources.\n\nFor detailed information, contacting the course directly or visiting their website might provide additional insights or access to resources like course maps or scorecards that highlight water features.",
