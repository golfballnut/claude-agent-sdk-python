## 🏗️ Infrastructure Validated

### What's Proven:
1. ✅ **Multi-stage Docker build** (Python 3.11 + Node.js 20 + Claude CLI)
2. ✅ **Claude Code CLI** accessible in container
3. ✅ **Environment variables** passed correctly
4. ✅ **FastAPI wrapper** works in production
5. ✅ **Agent 7** executes successfully
6. ✅ **Perplexity API** calls work from Render
7. ✅ **Health checks** functioning
8. ✅ **Auto-deployment** from GitHub working

### Architecture Validated:
```
GitHub Push → Render Auto-Deploy → Docker Build → Container Running → API Live
                                                                          ↓
                                        Agent 7 → Claude SDK → Perplexity API
                                                        ↓
                                            Returns water hazard count
```

**This architecture will work for all 8 agents!**

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Perfectly:
1. **Local Docker testing** → Caught dependency issue early
2. **Context7 docs** → Provided correct anyio version (>=4.6)
3. **`.env` file approach** → Secure and convenient
4. **Render dashboard** → Easy to fix root directory and Dockerfile path
5. **MCP tools** → Automated service creation and env var updates

### Issues Encountered & Resolved:
1. ✅ **Dependency conflict** - Fixed anyio version (4.2.0 → 4.6.0)
2. ✅ **Dockerfile COPY paths** - Updated to use deployment/ prefix
3. ✅ **Render configuration** - Set rootDir via dashboard
4. ✅ **All resolved quickly** - Total time: 1 hour

### Best Practices Validated:
- ✅ Test locally in Docker first (catches 90% of issues)
- ✅ Use flexible version pins (>=) not exact (==)
- ✅ Commit early, commit often
- ✅ Use official docs (Context7) for dependency info
- ✅ Keep API keys in .env (never commit)
