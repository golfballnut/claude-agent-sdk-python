## Agent 1: URL Finder ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed:** 2025-10-16

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ `debug_agent.py` - Production-ready implementation

**Performance:**
- Cost: $0.0153/search (24% under budget)
- Accuracy: 100% (5/5 correct)
- Speed: 3.4s average
- Model: claude-haiku-4-5

**Pattern Proven:**
- Smart tool (pre-process 78K → 2K tokens)
- SDK MCP server (in-process)
- Strict tool restrictions
- max_turns=2 for cost control

---

## Agent 3: Contact Enricher ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed:** 2025-10-16

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ `batch_test_agent3.py` - Batch testing framework
- ✅ `results/agent3_batch_test_results.json` - 12 contact enrichments

**Performance:**
- Email Success: 50% (6/12 contacts via Hunter.io)
- LinkedIn Success: 25% (3/12 bonus from Hunter.io!)
- Cost: $0.0116/contact (42% under budget)
- Confidence: 95-98% when found
- Speed: ~8s per contact
- Model: claude-haiku-4-5

**Pattern Proven:**
- Custom tool with Hunter.io API
- 5-step fallback sequence

- max_turns=2
- JSON-only output

**BREAKTHROUGH Discovery:**
- Hunter.io Email-Finder returns `linkedin_url` field!
- Single API call gets BOTH email + LinkedIn
- No extra cost for LinkedIn data
- 50% of emails also include LinkedIn URLs
- **Agent 4 not needed** - One agent does both!

---

## Agent 4: LinkedIn Finder ❌ CANCELLED

**Reason:** Hunter.io Email-Finder includes `linkedin_url` field!

**Discovery:**
- Tested Hunter.io MCP tool via Claude Code
- Found linkedin_url in response (undocumented feature!)
- 50% of successful email lookups also return LinkedIn
- No extra API call or cost needed

**Decision:** Merged into Agent 3 (Contact Enricher)

  "segmentation": {
    "primary_target": "high-end|budget|both",
    "confidence": 1-10,
    "signals": ["indicator1", "indicator2"]
  },
  "range_intel": {
    "has_range": true|false,
    "volume_signals": [],
    "quality_complaints": [],
    "budget_signals": []
  },
  "opportunities": {
