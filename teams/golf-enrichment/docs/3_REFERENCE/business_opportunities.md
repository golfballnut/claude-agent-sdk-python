## Core Revenue Streams

### 1. Range Ball Buy Program (High-End Clubs)

**Target:** Premium/private clubs with practice ranges

**Value Proposition:** "Turn waste into revenue - we buy your used range balls that you're currently throwing away"

**Scoring Signals (1-10):**

- ✅ Sustainability initiatives (waste reduction angle)
- ❌ Budget constraints mentioned
- ❌ Public/affordable positioning

**Conversation Starters:**
- "Are you currently disposing of used range balls once they show wear, or have you explored recycling programs?"
- "Many premium clubs are reducing waste by selling their used range balls to be reconditioned - interested in learning how this creates revenue?"
- "With your commitment to quality [mention specific upgrade/renovation], we'd love to discuss how our range ball buyback program could complement your sustainability goals"

**Objection Handling:**
- "How do you ensure quality?" → We only recondition balls <50% worn, same ones your members were using
- "What's the pricing?" → Based on volume and quality, typically $X-Y per dozen
- "Logistics?" → We handle pickup and sorting - zero hassle for you

- "How much are you currently spending on new range balls annually? We can typically cut that cost by 40-60%"

**Objection Handling:**
- "Will members notice?" → Our protective coating makes them look and feel like new
